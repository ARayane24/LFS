# step 3.2
to change "root" key word in the system edit step3.2 file !!


The utmp, wtmp, btmp, and lastlog files use 32-bit integers for timestamps and they'll be fundamentally broken after year 2038. Many packages have stopped using them and other packages are going to stop using them. It is probably best to consider them deprecated.


.a => static lib
.o => dynamic lib

Chap 2.4: Creating new partition (Any separate partition that you want automatically mounted when the system starts must be specified in the /etc/fstab
file.)
    part 1 : /boot partition (~ 200 Mb) should be the 1st partition (Note: 500 Mb)
    part 2 : main NEW distro (10 ~ 40 Gb) (Note: 70Gb)
    part 3 : swap for the new distro (1 ~ 3 Gb) (Note:  can be the same as the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary to create another one.)
    part 4 : GRUB partition (~ 1 Mb) (Note: 500 Mb)
    part 5 : /boot/efi for UEFI (~ 200 Mb) (Note: 500 Mb)
    part 6 : /opt where multiple large packages like KDE or Texlive can be installed without embedding the files in the /usr hierarchy (Note: 30Gb)
